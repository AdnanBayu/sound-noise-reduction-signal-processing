Processing audio signal captured from INMP441 sensor to ESP32. This project created for Advanced Signal Processing college subject final project.

## Project activity
Several activity conducted on this project to analyzed signal and conduct filtering
- Capture dataset of cafe noise using laptop internal microphone
- Capture ambience noise using INMP441 mic module to ESP32
- Analyzed signal in frequency domain using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
- Filtered non continous signal using STFT and Low pass filter
- Filtered continous signal using butterworth filter coefficient
